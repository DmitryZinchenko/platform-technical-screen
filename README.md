To create the following project I have used [Amazon Corretto 17 JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html) and [JetBrains IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=mac) (Community Edition is fine).

This is a Maven project, so it will download all the required dependencies (JUnit Platform and JUnit Jupiter) for running unit tests. To execute unit tests select *RoboticArmTest.java* file and then *Run "RoboticArmTest"*.
